**BreakMyWebsite** is a hands-on educational platform designed to teach **System Design**, **Chaos Engineering**, and **Site Reliability Engineering (SRE)** by doing the unthinkable: intentionally breaking real systems.

Most tutorials tell you how to build; we show you why systems fail so you can build them better.
